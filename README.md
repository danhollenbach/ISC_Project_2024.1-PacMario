# Projeto-ISC-2024.1-Fake Pacman
 A pacmanish game coded in assembly Risc V for a college project

# HOW TO PLAY:
1. Drag and drop "game.s" to "fpgrars-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu" and wait for game to boot
2. Press "m" to begin game
3. w, a, s, d keys to move the character, and "m" skips one level, just so every level can be played even if the player does not fulfill win conditions
4. THE GAME CAN ONLY BE PLAYED ONCE PER FILE RUN, if you want to play again, exit the game and repeat the process

Have fun!!
